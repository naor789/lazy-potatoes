Lazy Potatoes Project

The couch potatoes are rejoicing!
We designed a WPA that will allow you to stay in your couch, no matter what you need.
Need a bottle of milk? a burrakas? coffee? Your neighbors have you covered.

Check our app, select your area, and see where your neighbors are going shopping, and if they agree to help out a potato in need. With a smart system of point exchanges, you can ask your neighbor to bring you that coveted soup from your local store.
